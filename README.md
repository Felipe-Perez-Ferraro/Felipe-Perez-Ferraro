# :fireworks: Felipe Perez Ferraro

**`Front-End Developer`**

Hi! I am Felipe, a future full-stack developer currently improving my skills at Microverse, a remote software development program that uses pair programming and project building to teach software development. I started by doing simple pages with no interactions and these last few months I did a lot of interactive websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

  <summary><h3>:briefcase: Felipe's Microverse Journey</h3></summary>
  <p>
    Hi! I am Felipe, a full-stack developer currently improving my skills at Microverse, a remote software development program that uses pair programming and project building to teach software development.
 
  So far, I have built projects such as Awesome Books, a website that allows charging your favorite books and storing them. I started by doing simple pages with no interactions and these last few months I did a lot of interactive websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. 
  
  Before I entered this program I used to work with WordPress and study by myself, but now thanks to Microverse, my technical skills and English have improved a lot.
  The things that set me apart as a professional are my listening, comprehension, and problem-solving skills.
  
  After going through the Microverse Program, I'd love a chance to contribute back to the team. Can we have an interview this week so I better showcase what Iâ€™ll bring to your team?
